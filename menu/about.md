My main project at the time is the [Russian school competitive programming website](https://gym1505.github.io/hub) also known as the Hub.

I have created several competitive programming practice contests for the school as well. The links to them can be found on the Hub.

My open-source project contributions include an article for [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorightms.com), one of the biggest learning websites for competitive programming, and minor changes for several other repositories. You can see the whole list on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maleksware).
